## 🔐 Security Policy

Your privacy and data security are our top priorities. Here's how we keep your assistant safe:

### ✅ Local-First Execution

* All data operations (voice, calendar, DB) are processed **locally** unless explicitly using APIs (e.g., weather or search).

### ✅ Environment Variables

* Secrets (email, API keys) are stored securely in `.env` and **never hardcoded**.

### ✅ No Data Leaks

* No analytics, tracking, or external logs.
* Assistant only sends API requests **when required by you**.

### ✅ Optional Encryption

* You can extend to encrypt `.db` files using `cryptography` or `sqlitecipher`.

> **Tip:** Use strong passwords, app-specific email tokens, and enable 2FA on all integrated accounts.
